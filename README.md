# Analyzing Bike Sales Across the Globe 2011-2016
Compiled By: Jonathan Cao

# Project Background and Overview 
The purpose of this project is to analyze general trends in bike sales by using descriptive statistics to identify key patterns. The dataset used, titled "Bike Sales in Europe," was sourced from Kaggle.com and consists of 18 features and 113,036 observations. This data encompasses sales information from a bike retail chain operating across six countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, spanning the years 2011 to 2016. 

# Project Goals 
The main goal of this project is to: 
1. What is the spending by age and gender?

2. What country is the best place to sell bikes?

3. Which months of the year have the highest/lowest sales

# Process
1. Data Cleansing: to ensure the reliability of the analysis, data preprocessing and cleaning were conducted to eliminate missing or duplicate entries, resulting in a high-quality dataset for meaningful insights.

2. Data analytics: descriptive statistics methods were instrumental in identifying and addressing the project's goals. Pivot tables in Excel were utilized to summarize and analyze sales data, Tableau was used to create dynamic visualizations, and SQL queries were employed to extract and analyze targeted subsets of data. These methods enabled the identification of profit distribution across various demographic categories, insights into country-specific performance along with seasonal trends, and leading performance categories based on sales metrics.

3. Interpreting results: The insights gained from the analysis can provide actionable insights to enhance profitability and optimize operations.

4. Recommendations: By creating recommendations to maximize the company's performance and profitability, the company can make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and drive sustainable growth.

# Interpretation
With our three research questions answered, we find that: 
1. Males tend to spend 4% more than females on bikes and accessories.

2. Adults ages 35-64 bring in the most profits from the specified age groups.

3. The United States brings in the most sales out of the countries with bike stores.

4. The three months with the highest sales are May, June, and December. 

Understanding which demographic groups, such as gender and age, drive the highest profits allows for targeted marketing campaigns and tailored product offerings. Identifying the most profitable countries helps prioritize market expansion and allocate resources strategically, focusing efforts on regions with the greatest potential for growth. Finally, recognizing seasonal sales patterns enables better inventory management and ensures adequate stock during peak months while minimizing excess during slower periods. 

# Recommendations 
Based on the interpretation of these findings, we can create strategic recommendations to maximize the company's performance and profitability.
